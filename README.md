Foursquare ICS file converter to Excel spreadsheet formats.

I wrote this because I needed to do some cleanup of my Foursquare checkins and wanted a way to do this in Excel. This requires that an ICS file of Foursquare checkins - downloadable from your Foursquare History page - be present in the same directory as the conversion file.

This could be tweaked fairly easily to pull the needed ICS file from the Foursquare servers directly.
